## Features

- Mark your workouts anywhere

- Two different workouts (Running, Cycling)
- Calculate your pace, cadence and other data
- delete your workouts
- So many other cool features

NOTE: After submitting your workouts, your city and country must be shown on the map but sometimes your city and country might not show due to the problem the Geocode API has. There was nothing I could do about that. Anyway, enjoy the app.
